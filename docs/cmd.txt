based on @URS-QUICK-REGISTRATION.txt, start implement by creating the content pages in @QS-1 , to make a complete flow and using suitable component, proper ui ux, and must achieve all requirement, phase by phase acorrding to @URS-QUICK-REGISTRATION.txt .

- you may refer the look or functionalties of component that has in @kitchen-sink and pritize the use of component that are exist in this project codebase. 
- make sure plan and run phase 1 first and let me review by run and let me test the pages. 
- make sure to follow guideline in pdf  ui ux, and then dont miss out anything from the requirement.
- make sure to use proper font heirachy, proper font, proper padding, propper layout that is ux ui priotized and be creative dont stuck with old design, okay?

must follow all requirement, follow all guideline.


Begin implementation by carefully analyzing the requirements specified 
in @URS-QUICK-REGISTRATION.txt and initiate development by crafting the corresponding content 
pages within @QS-1, following a structured, phase-by-phase approach to ensure complete coverage 
and alignment with the documented functional and non-functional requirements. For every screen, 
interaction, and user journey in Phase 1, prioritize the usage of existing components already available 
within the @kitchen-sink project to maintain consistency, reduce development time, and ensure tested UI behaviors 
are leveraged, while also aligning tightly with the project's established codebase and component architecture. 
In each phase—starting with Phase 1—ensure that the UI/UX follows the PDF design guidelines precisely, applying c
orrect font hierarchy, using the designated font family, ensuring generous and consistent padding, logical spacing,
 accessible layout structuring, and overall fluidity in navigation and responsiveness, all while being visually modern, 
 user-centric, and creatively refined beyond outdated design patterns. Don’t hardcode or force legacy layouts; instead, 
 interpret the user needs and requirements imaginatively while still adhering strictly to the provided documentation and standards.
 Once Phase 1 is implemented, make it fully functional and ready for hands-on testing and review, allowing iterative refinement 
 before proceeding to subsequent phases, ensuring the development process remains agile, testable, and tightly scoped to the 
 expectations laid out in both the URS document and the UI/UX PDF.

 ui must follow @UI UX Design Specifications v0.2 Draft.md to be exact so can match the document
